\# Semantic Library Search



\## Project Overview

This repository contains my personal copy of a group project completed for \*\*ELEC 376\*\* at \*\*Queen’s University\*\*.



The project focuses on building a \*\*semantic search system\*\* for a library-style dataset, allowing users to retrieve relevant results based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching.



\## Group Project Disclaimer

This was a \*\*group project\*\* developed collaboratively as part of a course requirement.



\- The original group repository is hosted on a private GitLab instance managed by the course.

\- This GitHub repository is a personal mirror created for:

&nbsp; - Portfolio purposes

&nbsp; - Personal learning

&nbsp; - Demonstrating my contributions and understanding



I do \*\*not\*\* claim sole authorship of all code in this repository.



\## My Contributions

While this was a collaborative group project, I made significant individual contributions to both the technical implementation and overall development process.



My personal contributions included:



\- \*\*Semantic Search Implementation\*\*

&nbsp; - Helped design and implement the core semantic search pipeline

&nbsp; - Worked with text embeddings to enable meaning-based retrieval

&nbsp; - Assisted in tuning similarity metrics to improve result relevance



\- \*\*Data Processing \& Integration\*\*

&nbsp; - Contributed to preprocessing and organizing the library dataset

&nbsp; - Helped integrate data ingestion with the search pipeline

&nbsp; - Assisted in debugging data inconsistencies and edge cases



\- \*\*Code Development \& Debugging\*\*

&nbsp; - Implemented and refined C++ and Python modules related to search logic

&nbsp; - Debugged runtime errors and improved code stability

&nbsp; - Refactored portions of the codebase for clarity and maintainability



\- \*\*Testing \& Validation\*\*

&nbsp; - Assisted in testing search accuracy and performance

&nbsp; - Helped validate outputs against expected results

&nbsp; - Participated in identifying limitations and potential improvements



\- \*\*Collaboration \& Version Control\*\*

&nbsp; - Actively used Git and GitLab for version control

&nbsp; - Worked with branches, merges, and pull/merge requests

&nbsp; - Resolved merge conflicts and maintained a clean commit history



\## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:



\- Applying semantic search concepts to real datasets

\- Working with NLP embeddings and similarity measures

\- Managing collaborative software development using Git

\- Debugging and improving moderately sized codebases

\- Communicating technical ideas within a team setting
